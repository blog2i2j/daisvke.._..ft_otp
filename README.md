# ft_otp

## Description
This a program that allows you to store
an initial password in file, and that is capable of generating a new one time password
every time it is requested.<br />

## Commands
```
make
./ft_otp -<option> <file name>

◦ -g: The program receives as argument a hexadecimal key of at least 64 char-
acters. The program stores this key safely in a file called ft_otp.key, which
is encrypted with AES encryption.
◦ -k: The program generates a new temporary password based on the key given
as argument and prints it on the standard output.
```

• The one-time password is randomly generated by the HOTP algorithm (RFC 4226), and always contains the
same format, i.e. 6 digits.
